\title{Compute the Extended Persistence Diagrams of a given image}
\usage{
extendedPersistence(
  bdryCurves,
  imgName,
  nDirections,
  tolerance = 1/sqrt(2),
  saveOutput = FALSE,
  outputDir = NULL,
  fName = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bdryCurves}{A list containing points along the boundary curves of the
image. The list must have length number_of_curves + 1 with the first entry a
vector whose entries are the numbers of positively oriented curves and
negatively oriented curves, respectively. All of the positively oriented
curves must be listed before the negatively oriented curves.}

\item{imgName}{A string giving the name of the image.}

\item{nDirections}{An integer giving the number of directions to use. This
must be positive and even.}

\item{tolerance}{Parameter to control the noise from the image. Any vertices
closer than this in a particular direction will be classified as noise and
ignored. (Default: 1/sqrt(2))}

\item{saveOutput}{If TRUE, will save output to directory specified by
outputDir. (Default: FALSE)}

\item{outputDir}{The directory to save the output. If saveOutput is TRUE and
no directory is specified, saves to working directory. (Default: NULL)}

\item{fName}{The name of the output file saved. If saveOutput is TRUE and no
filename specified, prompts user for filename. (Default: NULL)}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, prints indictors of progress throughout.
(Default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
A list of length 5 with names "Name", "Ord0", "Rel1", "Ext0",
"Ext1". Each entry is a list
containing the relevant part of the extended persistence diagram. The i-th
entry corresponds to the i-th direction.
}
\description{
Given a disjoint collection of simple closed curves representing the
boundaries of a two dimensional shape, compute the zeroth order extended
persistent homology transform of the shape in a given number of directions.
}
\details{
Computing the extended persistent homology in a given direction requires
information about the orientation of a curve. This information is used in
determining whether a vertex is a local minimum with respect to the
foreground of the original image.
