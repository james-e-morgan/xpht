\title{Extract the boundary curves of a binary image}
\usage{
extractBoundary(
  img,
  background = 0,
  saveOutput = FALSE,
  outputDir = NULL,
  fName = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{A binary image read in from the imager package.}

\item{background}{The value of the background, 0 for black and 1 for white.
(Default: 0)}

\item{saveOutput}{If TRUE, will save output to directory specified by
outputDir. (Default: FALSE)}

\item{outputDir}{The directory to save the output. If saveOutput is TRUE and
no directory is specified, saves to working directory. (Default: NULL)}

\item{fName}{The name of the output file saved. If saveOutput is TRUE and no
filename specified, prompts user for filename. (Default: NULL)}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, prints indictors of progress throughout.
(Default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
A list containing the the points around each boundary curve of the
image as matrices.
}
\description{
Given a binary image (pixel values 0 and 1) extractBoundary will trace all
boundary curves along the midpoints of pixel edges between foreground and
background regions. Curves which bound the outside of a foreground region
are traced in the anticlockwise direction while curves which bound the
inside of a foreground region are traced in the clockwise direction.
}
\details{
The image is padded with a 1-pixel wide border of background. Each connected
component of the image is labelled as follows:
- Foreground pixels are labelled with positive integers (1,2,3,...).
- Background pixels are labelled with negative integers (-1,-2,...).
- The outermost background region is labelled with -1.
\subsection{OUTPUT}{

The boundary information is stored in the list boundary, structured as
follows:
- boundary[\link{1}] is a vector (m,n) containing the number of
anticlockwise and clockwise curves.
- boundary[\link{2}] to boundary[\link{m+1}] contain the anticlockwise curves.
- boundary[\link{m+2}] to boundary[\link{n+1}] contain the clockwise curves.
If set to save, the list is saved as an RDS file.
