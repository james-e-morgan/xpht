Description: An implementation of the extended persistent homology
    transform (XPHT) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2208.14583> for shape statistics 
    of two dimensional binary images. This is done by computing the extended 
    persistent homology of the boundary curves of the image in multiple evenly 
    spaced directions similar to Turner et al. (2014) 
    <doi:10.1093/imaiai/iau011>.  
    We offer functionality for plotting extended persistence diagrams and 
    barcodes as well as the Wasserstein \eqn{p} distance matrix.
